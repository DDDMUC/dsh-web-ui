# Community preset catalog

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The publishing source for community agent presets distributed through the
Workshop. `scripts/market-build` reads this directory and emits
`market/dist/manifest/presets.json` plus `market/dist/assets/presets/<id>/`.

## Add a preset

1. Copy `_template/` to `<id>/`. The directory name is the preset id and must
   match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`; ids the harness ships (`minimal`, `ptc`,
   `standard`, `cordis`) are refused.
2. Edit `preset.yml` (the display text the DSH roster shows: `name`,
   `description`, optional `order`; keep each on one line) and
   `agent.cordis.yml` (the composition).
3. Add a `catalog.json` entry:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "<id>",
     "nameEn": "English name",
     "descriptionEn": "One sentence in English.",
     "author": "github-handle",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "tags": ["review"],
     "rank": 10,
     "repo": "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>"
   }
   ```

   `id`, `author` and `version` are required; `version` drives the Workshop's
   update notification. The Chinese `name`/`description` come from `preset.yml`
   so the DSH roster and the store never disagree.
4. Run `node scripts/market-build` and commit the regenerated `market/dist`.

## What review checks

A preset is code: its composition can name npm plugins, load files that travel
inside the preset directory, and evaluate `!!js` expressions in the DSH host
process. The Workshop therefore installs a preset into an inert library and
only moves it into the discovery root when the user enables it, after showing
the composition profile. Submissions are reviewed for what the composition
loads and why, not only for what it claims to do.
